# MASTERDB Registry API (Phase 4)

Knowledge Package Lifecycle, Provenance/Lineage, and Retrieval Readiness
endpoints. These are additive to the validation/certification endpoints
above and operate on `KnowledgePackage` records rather than raw dataset
reports.

## POST /packages/register

Registers a new `KnowledgePackage` in status `REGISTERED`.

Request:

```json
{
  "dataset_id": "sample-certified",
  "dataset_version": "1.0.0",
  "schema_version": "2",
  "board": "AI",
  "medium": "text",
  "language": "en",
  "owner": "kavy",
  "actor": "pipeline",
  "reason": "Initial package registration."
}
```

Response: the full `KnowledgePackage`, including `package_id` and a
one-entry `history` recording the `REGISTERED` transition.

## POST /packages/promote


Moves a package to the next lifecycle status. Rejects any edge not present
in the lifecycle graph (see `ARCHITECTURE.md`) with `400`.

Request:

```json
{
  "package_id": "pkg-...",
  "to_status": "INGESTED",
  "actor": "pipeline",
  "reason": "Ingestion pipeline completed."
}
```

Response: the updated `KnowledgePackage` with the new transition appended
to `history`.

## POST /packages/deprecate

Convenience endpoint that always transitions to `DEPRECATED`, valid from any
non-terminal, non-deprecated status.

Request:

```json
{
  "package_id": "pkg-...",
  "actor": "owner",
  "reason": "Superseded by a newer dataset version."
}
```

## GET /packages/{package_id}

Returns the current `KnowledgePackage` record, including its full `history`.

## GET /packages/{package_id}/history

Returns just the transition history:

```json
{
  "package_id": "pkg-...",
  "history": [
    {
      "transition_id": "txn-...",
      "from_status": null,
      "to_status": "REGISTERED",
      "reason": "Initial package registration.",
      "actor": "pipeline",
      "timestamp": "2026-07-06T00:00:00+00:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

## POST /packages/{package_id}/knowledge-object

Registers a `KnowledgeObject` (provenance/lineage pointer) for a package.
Not one of the seven endpoints named in the sprint spec, but required to
exercise `/lineage` and `/retrieval` meaningfully — it is the write side of
the Knowledge Object & Provenance Engine. `package_id` in the path and body
must match.

Request:

```json
{
  "package_id": "pkg-...",
  "parent_package": null,
  "source_reference": "s3://bucket/source.csv",
  "lineage_reference": null,
  "derivation_path": ["ingest", "clean"]
}
```

`400` if `parent_package` is set but does not exist, or if schema versions
are major-version incompatible with the declared parent.

## GET /packages/{package_id}/lineage

Returns ancestor chain and declared descendants for a package's Knowledge
Object, plus any `known_gaps` in the current MDU contract placeholder.

```json
{
  "package_id": "pkg-...",
  "knowledge_object_registered": true,
  "knowledge_object_id": "kobj-...",
  "knowledge_hash": "…",
  "source_reference": "s3://bucket/source.csv",
  "lineage_reference": null,
  "derivation_path": ["ingest", "clean"],
  "ancestors": [],
  "descendants": [],
  "known_gaps": ["source_reference: Placeholder: assumed to be a URI/path string..."]
}
```

## GET /packages/{package_id}/retrieval

Runs the Retrieval Readiness Engine and returns a `RetrievalEvidence`
artifact. Certification alone does not imply retrievability; see
`ARCHITECTURE.md` for the rule set.

```json
{
  "package_id": "pkg-...",
  "status": "PARTIALLY_RETRIEVABLE",
  "rules": [
    {"rule": "PACKAGE_CERTIFIED", "passed": true, "detail": "Package status is CERTIFIED."},
    {"rule": "NOT_DEPRECATED_OR_ARCHIVED", "passed": true, "detail": "Package is active."},
    {"rule": "METADATA_COMPLETE", "passed": true, "detail": "All required package metadata fields are present."},
    {"rule": "LINEAGE_REGISTERED", "passed": false, "detail": "No knowledge object with a source_reference is registered for this package."}
  ],
  "corrective_actions": [
    "Register a Knowledge Object with a source_reference for this package via the Knowledge Object & Provenance Engine."
  ],
  "generated_at": "2026-07-06T00:00:00+00:00"
}
```

## Uniform Error Contract (Phase 4)

Every error response — validation failure, missing entity, invalid lifecycle
transition, upstream MDU failure, or unhandled exception — is shaped the
same way, so any consumer (TANTRA included) can parse errors generically:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "http_error",
    "message": "No package found for package_id=unknown",
    "path": "/packages/unknown"
  }
}
```

`type` is one of: `http_error` (expected 4xx conditions — not found, invalid
transition, upstream MDU failure surfaced as 502) or `internal_error` (an
unhandled 500; logged server-side with a stack trace, never leaked to the
caller).

Unknown package:

```json
{"error": {"type": "http_error", "message": "No package found for package_id=unknown", "path": "/packages/unknown"}}
```

Illegal lifecycle transition:

```json
{"error": {"type": "http_error", "message": "Cannot transition package pkg-... from REGISTERED to CERTIFIED. Allowed transitions from REGISTERED: ['INGESTED', 'DEPRECATED'].", "path": "/packages/promote"}}
```

## GET /packages/{package_id}/replay (Phase 4)

Recomputes lifecycle status purely by walking the recorded transition
history and validates every hop against the lifecycle graph, independent of
the stored `status` field. Used to detect drift/corruption.

```json
{"package_id": "pkg-...", "replay_consistent": true, "replayed_status": "CERTIFIED"}
```

## GET /packages/{package_id}/audit (Phase 4)

Audit-completeness report: checks the transition history has exactly one
root transition, every transition has a non-empty actor/reason/timestamp,
timestamps are monotonic, and folds in the replay-consistency result.

```json
{
  "package_id": "pkg-...",
  "complete": true,
  "issues": [],
  "replay_consistent": true,
  "replay_error": null,
  "transition_count": 3
}
```

# Phase 1 — MDU Integration Endpoints

MASTERDB does not own schema/provenance/lineage semantics. These endpoints
expose what MDU reports, plus MASTERDB's own version-negotiation decision
on top of it. Configure `MDU_BASE_URL` / `MDU_API_KEY` as environment
variables to enable live mode; without them every call below degrades to a
flagged placeholder rather than failing.

## GET /mdu/status

```json
{"live": true, "contract_finalized": false, "known_gaps": ["knowledge_object_id: ...", "..."]}
```

## GET /mdu/schema/{dataset_id}

Passes through MDU's `GET /api/v1/schemas/dataset/{dataset_id}` response
verbatim. Returns `502` with the uniform error contract if MDU is
unreachable.

## GET /mdu/provenance/{dataset_id}

Passes through MDU's `GET /api/v1/datasets/{dataset_id}/provenance`
response verbatim (this is MDU's documented lineage contract).

## GET /mdu/schema-compatibility/{dataset_id}?local_schema_version=1.0

Compares a locally-declared `schema_version` against MDU's canonical
schema for the dataset, using MASTERDB's own negotiation rule (exact match
/ minor-version drift / major-version mismatch):

```json
{
  "source": "mdu-live",
  "dataset_id": "BHIV-DS-MARITIME-AIS-LIVE-001",
  "mdu_schema_version": "2.1",
  "local_schema_version": "2.1",
  "compatible": true,
  "negotiation": "exact_match",
  "reason": ""
}
```

If MDU is unreachable/unconfigured:

```json
{
  "source": "placeholder",
  "compatible": true,
  "reason": "MDU not configured; falling back to permissive placeholder check (no hard-fail on unconfirmed contract).",
  "known_gaps": ["..."]
}
```

# Phase 2 — MASTERDB <-> TANTRA Runtime Interface

The single surface TANTRA integrates against. All endpoints are read-mostly
façades over MASTERDB's existing registry/lineage/retrieval services — no
new ownership is introduced here.

## POST /tantra/datasets/register

Request/response identical to `POST /packages/register` (see above); this
is the TANTRA-facing alias of the same operation, recorded with
`actor="tantra"` by default.

## GET /tantra/packages/{package_id}/retrieval-readiness

Identical response shape to `GET /packages/{package_id}/retrieval`.

## GET /tantra/certification/{dataset_id}

```json
{
  "dataset_id": "sample-certified",
  "state": "CERTIFIED",
  "classification": "Trusted",
  "integrity_score": 100.0,
  "eligible_for_masterdb": true
}
```

`404` (uniform error contract) if no certification report exists for that
`dataset_id`.

## GET /tantra/packages/{package_id}/runtime

The bundled runtime-lookup view: lifecycle state, lineage, retrieval
readiness, and certification status (best-effort, by `dataset_id`) in one
call.

```json
{
  "package": {"package_id": "pkg-...", "dataset_id": "ds-1", "status": "CERTIFIED", "...": "..."},
  "lineage": {"package_id": "pkg-...", "knowledge_object_registered": true, "...": "...", "mdu_provenance": {"source": "mdu-live", "dataset_id": "ds-1", "provenance": {"...": "..."}}},
  "retrieval_readiness": {"package_id": "pkg-...", "status": "RETRIEVABLE", "rules": ["..."]},
  "certification_status": {"dataset_id": "ds-1", "state": "CERTIFIED", "...": "..."}
}
```

---

# Phase 3 — Runtime Discovery API

## GET /discovery/packages

Deterministic filtered lookup shared by TANTRA and any other downstream
consumer — no ranking or relevance scoring, results always sorted by
`package_id` so identical queries against identical state return identical
order.

Query parameters (all optional, combinable): `package_id`, `dataset_id`,
`board`, `medium`, `version` (matches either `dataset_version` or
`schema_version`), `status` (one of the `PackageStatus` enum values).

```
GET /discovery/packages?board=maritime&status=CERTIFIED
```

```json
{
  "count": 2,
  "packages": [
    {"package_id": "pkg-aaa...", "dataset_id": "ds-1", "board": "maritime", "status": "CERTIFIED", "...": "..."},
    {"package_id": "pkg-bbb...", "dataset_id": "ds-2", "board": "maritime", "status": "CERTIFIED", "...": "..."}
  ]
}
```
