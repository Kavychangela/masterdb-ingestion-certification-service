"""
Adapter interface for the MDU (Nupur) canonical contracts.

MASTERDB does NOT own Knowledge Object, Provenance, Lineage, or schema
contract semantics. Those are owned by MDU. This adapter is the single seam
MASTERDB code depends on for MDU-owned data, in two modes:

  - LIVE mode: an MDUClient is configured (MDU_BASE_URL / MDU_API_KEY) and
    reachable. The adapter fetches real schema/provenance contracts from
    MDU and reports back what MDU actually said — it does not reinterpret
    or "improve" that data.
  - PLACEHOLDER mode: no live MDU connection. The adapter falls back to the
    documented placeholder snapshot below so the rest of MASTERDB keeps
    working, and every response is tagged so callers know it is not
    MDU-confirmed.

Do NOT add new semantics here. If a field or rule is not confirmed by MDU,
mark it as a placeholder and keep the check permissive (log/flag rather than
hard-fail), so MASTERDB never silently invents ontology it doesn't own.
